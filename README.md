## Details

This repository includes examples of PCI-compliant UI integrations for online payments with Adyen. Within this demo app, you'll find a simplified version of an e-commerce website, complete with commented code to highlight key features and concepts of Adyen's API. Check out the underlying code to see how you can integrate Adyen to give your shoppers the option to pay with their preferred payment methods, all in a seamless checkout experience.

## Installation

1. Clone this repo:

```
git clone https://github.com/adyen-examples/adyen-java-spring-online-payments.git
```

## Usage

1. Set environment variables for the required configuration
    - [API key](https://docs.adyen.com/user-management/how-to-get-the-api-key)
    - [Client Key](https://docs.adyen.com/user-management/client-side-authentication)

    - [HMAC Key](https://docs.adyen.com/development-resources/webhooks/verify-hmac-signatures)

Remember to include `http://localhost:8080` in the list of Allowed Origins

On Linux/Mac export env variables
```shell
export ADYEN_API_KEY=yourAdyenApiKey
export ADYEN_MERCHANT_ACCOUNT=yourAdyenMerchantAccount
export ADYEN_CLIENT_KEY=yourAdyenClientKey
export ADYEN_HMAC_KEY=yourHmacKey
```

Alternatively it is possible to define the settings in the `application.properties`
```# application.properties
ADYEN_API_KEY=yourAdyenApiKey
ADYEN_MERCHANT_ACCOUNT=yourAdyenMerchantAccount
ADYEN_CLIENT_KEY=yourAdyenClientKey
ADYEN_HMAC_KEY=yourHmacKey
```
2. Start the server:

```
./gradlew bootRun
```

3. Visit [http://localhost:8080/](http://localhost:8080/) to select an integration type.

## Testing webhooks

Webhooks deliver asynchronous notifications and it is important to test them during the setup of your integration. You can find more information about webhooks in [this detailed blog post](https://www.adyen.com/blog/Integrating-webhooks-notifications-with-Adyen-Checkout).

This sample application provides a simple webhook integration exposed at `/api/webhooks/notifications`. For it to work, you need to:

1. Provide a way for the Adyen platform to reach your running application
2. Add a Standard webhook in your Customer Area

### Making your server reachable

Your endpoint that will consume the incoming webhook must be publicly accessible.

There are typically 3 options:
* deploy on your own cloud provider
* deploy on Gitpod
* expose your localhost with tunneling software (i.e. ngrok)

#### Option 1: cloud deployment
If you deploy on your cloud provider (or your own public server) the webhook URL will be the URL of the server 
```
  https://{cloud-provider}/api/webhooks/notifications
```

#### Option 2: Gitpod
If you use Gitpod the webhook URL will be the host assigned by Gitpod
```
  https://myorg-myrepo-y8ad7pso0w5.ws-eu75.gitpod.io/api/webhooks/notifications
```
**Note:** when starting a new Gitpod workspace the host changes, make sure to **update the Webhook URL** in the Customer Area

#### Option 3: localhost via tunneling software
If you use a tunneling service like [ngrok](ngrok) the webhook URL will be the generated URL (ie `https://c991-80-113-16-28.ngrok.io`)

```bash
  $ ngrok http 8080
  
  Session Status                online                                                                                           
  Account                       ############                                                                      
  Version                       #########                                                                                          
  Region                        United States (us)                                                                                 
  Forwarding                    http://c991-80-113-16-28.ngrok.io -> http://localhost:8080                                       
  Forwarding                    https://c991-80-113-16-28.ngrok.io -> http://localhost:8080           
```

**Note:** when restarting ngrok a new URL is generated, make sure to **update the Webhook URL** in the Customer Area

### Set up a webhook

* In the Customer Area go to Developers -> Webhooks and create a new 'Standard notification' webhook.
* Enter the URL of your application/endpoint (see options [above](#making-your-server-reachable))
* Define username and password for Basic Authentication
* Generate the HMAC Key
* Optionally, in Additional Settings, add the data you want to receive. A good example is 'Payment Account Reference'.
* Make sure the webhook is **Enabled** (therefore it can receive the notifications)

That's it! Every time you perform a new payment, your application will receive a notification from the Adyen platform.

## Deploying this example to the cloud

As part of this example, we are providing a [Terraform](https://www.terraform.io/) configuration file that can be used to deploy this demo to the Amazon cloud on a [Beanstalk](https://aws.amazon.com/elasticbeanstalk/) environment.

 ⚠️ This part will deploy (AWS) cloud resources and can incur charges ⚠️.


### Extra prerequisites

* The [AWS CLI](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/userguide/cli-chap-install.html), with a configured profile (and an AWS account).
* The [Terraform](https://www.terraform.io/) CLI, with the `terraform` executable in your PATH.
* Ready to use Adyen API and client keys.

### Usage

* Compile the project: `./gradlew build`
* Create a `terraform.tfvars` file in the root directory of this repository. Here is a example :

```
adyen_api_key = "testApiKey"
adyen_merchant_account = "testMerchantAccount"
adyen_client_key = "testClientKey"
adyen_hmac_key = "testHMACKey"
```

* Run the `terraform init` command to initialize the Terraform configuration, and `terraform apply` to deploy the environment.
* At the end of the deployment, Terraform will output several URLs :

```
adyen_url = "https://ca-test.adyen.com/ca/ca/config/showthirdparty.shtml"
demo_url = "http://adyen-spring-development-cc66dd5f.eu-west-1.elasticbeanstalk.com"
environment_url = "https://eu-west-1.console.aws.amazon.com/elasticbeanstalk/home?region=eu-west-1#/applications"
```

* You can access the demo using the `demo_url`.
* The `adyen_url` can be used to create a [notification webhook](https://docs.adyen.com/development-resources/webhooks) in the Adyen customer area.
* Use `terraform destroy` to remove the environment and avoid being charged for the resources more than necessary.
* The `environment_url` can be used to access the AWS Beanstalk environment and possibly update the configuration.
